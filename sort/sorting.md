# Sorting

The fastest possible algorithm that uses comparisons to sort $$N$$ items must use $$\text{O}(N \log{N})$$ time.

Sort algorithms such as insertion sort, selection sort & bubble sort are relatively simple but slow.&#x20;

Such as heap sort, quick sort, and merge sort, are more complicated but much faster.&#x20;

Sorting algorithms such as as counting sort and pigeonhole sort, don't use comparisons to sort items, so they can break the $$O(N \log{N})$$ barrier and perform amazingly fast under the right circumstances.
