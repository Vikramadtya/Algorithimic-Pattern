# Bubble Sort

The sorting algorithm works on the principle of moving the largest element to the end of the array just like a bubble moves up.

We do multiple pass over the array till its sorted, during each pass we compare the adjacent elements ( i.e `i` and `i+1`) and swap if the first is greater than the second. So at the end of the pass the largest element is at the top.

```java
// we will need n passess
for ( int i = n-1 ; i >= 0; i-- ) {
    for ( int j = 0; j+1 <= i; j++ ) {
        // swap if the current element 
        // is larger than the next
        if ( arr[j] < arr[j+1] ) {
            swap(arr,i,j);
        }
    }
}
```

After each pass, the last part of the array will become sorted. That is why the last index of the range decreases by 1 after each pass.&#x20;

This decrement is achieved by the outer loop and the last index is represented by variable `i` in the above code.&#x20;

The inner loop by `j` helps to push the maximum element of range `[0….i]` to the last index (i.e. `i`)\

If the array becomes sorted before all passes, to avoid unnecessary work we can have a small check to see if the array is already sorted

```java
boolean isSorted = true;

// we will need n passess
for ( int i = n-1 ; i >= 0; i-- ) {
    for ( int j = 0; j+1 <= i; j++ ) {
        // swap if the current element 
        // is larger than the next
        if ( arr[j] < arr[j+1] ) {
            swap(arr,i,j);
            isSorted = false;
        }
    }
    
    // if no swap took place the array is sorted 
    // break to avoid unneeded iteration 
    if(isSorted) break;
}
```

If the array is already sorted no swap will occur and we will break out from the loops.





{% hint style="info" %}
The best case occurs if the given array is already sorted due to the chaeck we find this in single iteration thus leading to best case complexity of $$\text{O}(n)$$
