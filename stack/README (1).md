# Stack

A _stack_ is a data structure where items are added and removed in last-in-first-out order ( sometimes called _LIFO lists_ or _LIFOs_ )

Adding an object to a stack is called pushing the object onto the stack, and removing an object from the stack is called popping the object off of the stack.

## Linked-List Stacks <a href="#head-3-55" id="head-3-55"></a>

Implementing a stack is easy using a linked list, with a linked list, pushing and popping items both have $$\text{O}(1)$$ run times.

* the `Push` method simply adds a new cell to the top of the list
* the `Pop` method removes the top cell from the list.



## Array Stacks

Allocate space for an array enough to hold the data expected to put in the stack. Then use a variable to keep track of the next empty position in the stack.\

With an array-based stack, `Push` and `Pop` have $$\text{O}(1)$$ run times.&#x20;

Setting and getting a value from an array generally is faster than creating a new cell in a linked list, so this method may be slightly faster than using a linked list.
{% endhint %}



An array-based stack requires extra space to hold new items, resizing the array will take extra time. If the array holds N items when you need to resize it, it will take $$\text{O}(n)$$ steps to copy those items into the newly resized array.

In case an algorithm needs to use two stacks whose combined size is bounded by some amount. Then can store both stacks in a single array, with one at each end and both growing toward the middle,
