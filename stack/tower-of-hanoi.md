# Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi puzzle (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower), has three pegs. One peg holds a stack of disks of different sizes, ordered from smallest to largest. The goal is to move all the disks from one peg to another. You must move disks one at a time, and you cannot place a disk on top of another disk that has a smaller radius
