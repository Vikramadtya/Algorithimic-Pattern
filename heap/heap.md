# Heap

A heap is a tree-like structure, each value has a relationship with its parent and child nodes.

* In a max heap, every parent value is greater than or equal to its children.&#x20;
* In a min heap, each parent value is less than or equal to its children.

Heap is a complete binary tree, it’s filled from the left side, and there are no “holes” except, on the last level.
