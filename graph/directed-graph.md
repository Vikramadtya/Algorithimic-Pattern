# Directed Graph

## Directed Acyclic Graph

* It is simply a directed graph which contains no cycles - it is impossible to start at one vertex, move along a sequence of arcs and end up in the same vertex

* Every DAG has at least one Topological Ordering.

## Sink Vertex

Sink vertex is the vertex which has no outbound edges.&#x20;
{% endhint %}



* A DAG has to have at least one **sink vertex**.  If we don’t have a sink vertex then that means that every edge will have at least one outgoing vertex and since we have finite vertices in our graph then by _**pigeon hole principle**_ that means that, we will be visiting one of the already visited vertices, which implies we would have a directed  cycle.



{% hint style="info" %}
A directed graph with no sink vertex must have cycle.
{% endhint %}



### Dynamic programming

*   If a directed graph is acyclic, dynamic programming can be applied to it.

    We can efficiently solve the following problems concerning paths from a starting node to an ending node

    * how many different paths are there?
    * what is the shortest/longest path?
    * what is the minimum/maximum number of edges in a path?&#x20;
    * which nodes certainly appear in any path?
