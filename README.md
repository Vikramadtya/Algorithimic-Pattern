# About

Hey! Welcome to this easy guide on **Algorithms and Data Structures**, these notes  are all about helping you develop a deeper understanding of algorithmic patterns—an essential skill for tackling complex coding problems efficiently.

I’ve broken down a wide range of algorithmic patterns, from foundational techniques to more advanced strategies. We'll cover things like arrays, linked lists, and sorting, step by step, with examples to understand the concepts better.&#x20;

This collection is designed to be a go-to reference for developers of all levels. Explore the patterns, experiment with the examples, and let's elevate the coding game together!
